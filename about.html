<p>Hi everyone! For those of you who don't know me in real life, I'm Kendal! Glad the digital universe has brought us together!</p>

<img src="images/ME.JPG">

<p>I'm a recent graduate from UC Berkeley (GO BEARS!) with degrees in Business Administration and Media Studies. I was fortunate enough to land a job right out of college at a great company who is not only leading the way in gender equality, including pay equality, in the workplace, but they also believe in giving recent grads ample time off post graduation. I'll begin work in sunny San Francisco mid October (thanks Gap Inc!), but until then I'll be using this time to pursue my travel dreams. For more info on where I'll be going check out my itinerary page here. For those of you who know me it won't come as any surprise that I'm trying to plan every little detail in advance!</p>

<p>I felt like there needed to be a place where I could talk about going after “it” no matter what it may be… travel goals, career goals, relationship goals. So I created Go Getter Gals as a way to share with you the ways I'm trying to go get the most out of life and share the stories of interesting people I meeting along the way, who are on their own journeys as #gogettergals!</p>

<p>I'm new to both writing publicly and traveling, so bare with me as I learn. Feedback on my blog? Travel advice? Know of an empty couch at one of my travel destinations? I'm all ears!</p>
